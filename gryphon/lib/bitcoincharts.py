        This function seems to be off frequently by about 1000 bitcoins
        from the graphs bitcoincharts gives. This may be because they
        don't operate in UTC or could be something more sinister.
        For now it acts as a reasonable approximation.

        The control flow of this function is a little bit hard to 
        understand immediately. Essentially it continues requesting more
        trades from bitcoincharts until it sees one that is after the 'end'
        argument, but we have to guard for several edge cases, such as when
        we're requesting the most recent period of trades, in which case
        we will never hit the normal termination condition.
