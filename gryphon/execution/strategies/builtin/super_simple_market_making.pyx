"""
This is a super simple market making strategy to demonstrate use of the Gryphon
framework. For being only 25 lines of code, this strategy has some very subtle logic to
it.

Every tick, we place orders on both sides of the orderbook at a 1% spread back from the
midpoint on the Bitstamp BTCUSD pair. The orders start at a size of 0.005 BTC. If either
of these orders are filled in any volume, the strategy is now at a net position. We want
to limit our absolute risk, so the strategy has a maximum position it will enter. To
avoid going past our max position, the order size on the side of our position is
decreased so that we should never be offering an order that would take us past our
maximum if it were filled.

This strategy is just an example, and should not be used for real trading.
